MOOSE : Matlab Tool for STPA Evaluation.
STPA (http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/get_file.php?name=STPA_handbook.pdf) is a safety analysis method developed at MIT, Massachusetts. I have made a simple Simulink library and provide two Matlab files to analyze the model. The details of the method are available in the handbook. The library has blocks for controller, actuator, process, loses, hazards and control actions. The user can make a hierarchical control structure (HCS) using these building blocks. The Matlab files read the HCS and generate a report that can be used for further analysis. This is a preliminary work and suggestions are welcome for updates. 

A manual is also provided in the Moose.pptx file to aid first time users

Any form of updates and feedback are welcome!
